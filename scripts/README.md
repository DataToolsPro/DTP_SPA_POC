Utility scripts and reference data for DTP_APP_V3 project setup and maintenance.

## tickets.json

Legacy reference file for initial infrastructure setup tickets. **Superseded by** [`docs/JIRA_TICKET_BACKLOG.md`](../docs/JIRA_TICKET_BACKLOG.md), which contains the full backlog including logical grouping, Waqar onboarding, all decisions/setup tasks, technical stack, and product discovery.

**Note:** Tickets should be created via MCP tools in Cursor or manually in Jira using the backlog doc.
