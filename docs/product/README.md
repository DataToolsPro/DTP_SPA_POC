## Product Principles

<!-- What guides decisions when there's a trade-off? -->
<!-- These help the AI (and developers) make the right call without asking every time -->

1. **[Principle 1]** — [short explanation]
2. **[Principle 2]** — [short explanation]
3. **[Principle 3]** — [short explanation]

Examples of strong principles:
- "Data integrity over speed — we never guess or auto-correct user data silently"
- "One workflow, done well — don't add features until the core is excellent"
- "Admin complexity is OK — end-user complexity is not"
