  "content_markdown": "## Log in with Salesforce.com\n\nDataTools Pro is a [Salesforce.com connected app](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_overview.htm&language=en_US&type=5 \"Salesforce connected app\") designed to enhance common tasks related to understanding metadata relationships like entity relationships, data dictionary, metrics, and analytics. To set up DataTools Pro, as of Oct 2025, you need a Salesforce administrator. [View DataTools Pro Salesforce Admin guide](/tutorials/salesforce-admin-install-guide/ \"Admin install guide\")\n\n**Troubleshooting Login Issues**\nSalesforce [OAUTH\\_APPROVAL\\_ERROR\\_GENERIC](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/salesforce-oauth_approval_error_generic/ \"OAUTH_APPROVAL_ERROR_GENERIC\") – Solved\n\n**What data does DataTools Pro access from Salesforce.com?**\n\nData Tools Pro is designed to connect only to Salesforce object metadata (object names, fields) and record metadata for Reports and Dashboards (report names, folders, last updated date). Data Tools Pro does not access or query any of your object record data that would contain customer information.\n\n- [Security FAQ](https://datatoolspro.com/datatoolspro-data-security-faq/ \"Security FAQ\")\n- [DataTools Pro Security Policy](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/security-policy-salesforce-connected-app/ \"DataTools Security Policy\")\n- [2025 Changes: Authorizing DataTools Connected App](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/authorizing-an-salesforce-uninstalled-app/ \"Authorizing Salesforce to DataTools\")\n\n## Connect to your Salesforce Objects\n\n**Object Explorer:** By default, you land on the [Object Dictionary](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/object-explorer-for-datatools-pro-dictionary/ \"Object Explorer for DataTools Pro Dictionary\"). The first step is to connect to the Salesforce objects that you want to understand, document, visualize, and/or migrate.\n\n1. Click “Select Objects”.\n\n![](https://datatoolspro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-8-1024x98.png)\n\n2. Choose the Salesforce objects that you actively manage for your job role.\n\n3. You can organize and categorize your Salesforce objects according to any business function, module or app using our [object views feature](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/data-tools-erd-and-object-views/ \"Data Tools Object and ERD Views\").\n\n**Field Dictionary**:\n\n1. Click on any object name\n\n![](https://datatoolspro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-9.png)\n\n2. The [field dictionary](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/salesforce-field-dictionary-with-datatools-pro/ \"Salesforce Field Dictionary with DataTools Pro\") will display a list of all fields along with pertinent data from Salesforce. This information can be refreshed on demand, or for Salesforce admins you can navigate directly to the object inside of Salesforce to perform admin tasks:\n\n![](https://datatoolspro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/image-10-1024x277.png)\n\nFrom the field dictionary, you have several features for viewing field changes, navigate to the Salesforce object manager (if you have the Salesforce permissions). View the [Field Dictionary](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/salesforce-field-dictionary-with-datatools-pro/ \"Salesforce Field Dictionary with DataTools Pro\") documentation for a complete list of features\n\n## Visualize your Objects in an Entity Relationship Diagram\n\n1. Select the [Entity Diagram](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/salesforce-erd-step-by-step-guide/ \"Salesforce Entity Relationship Diagram Step by Step Guide\") button option on the top navigation bar to view an interactive representation of the objects you have chosen.\n\nYou can always return to the dictionary tab to add more objects. As you accumulate objects, your ERD can get very crowded. For context we provide [object views feature](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/data-tools-erd-and-object-views/ \"Data Tools Object and ERD Views\") for your ERD.\n\n[Video: How to Create Salesforce Entity Relationship Diagram](https://www.youtube.com/embed/lHfOyQRie3w?feature=oembed)\n\n## Manage your Salesforce Related Metrics and KPIs\n\nOur roots as an “analytics first” team drove us to help organizations simplify curating and preparing a smart metrics glossary.
