For DataTools Pro we were lucky enough to narrow our migration to 3 objects.\n\nOur data platform of choice to stage and analyze data is Snowflake, so in this demo we import and stage our data without writing any code.\n\nWith our source objects identified, we can add and map our Salesforce objects in [DataTools Pro](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/data-migration-scorecard-for-salesforce/ \"Data Migration Scorecard for Salesforce\") and mark the first step of our migration complete in our [migration scorecard](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/data-migration-scorecard-for-salesforce/ \"Salesforce Data Migration Scorecard\")!\n\n## Step 2: Data Mapping in DataTools Pro\n\nWith our objects selected, it’s time to map individual fields from our Zoho instance to our new Salesforce instance. This is where [DataTools Pro field mapping](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/salesforce-migration-field-mapping-details/?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=linkedin&utm_content=erdstorytelling&utm_campaign=blogpost# \"Salesforce field Mapping\") features save tremendous time replacing Excel files.\n\n## Get the Source Data Schema\n\nOnce you upload your data, you can quickly obtain the source schema using the following code:\n\n```sql\nSELECT COLUMN_NAME, DATA_TYPE\nFROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS\nWHERE TABLE_SCHEMA = 'STAGE' -- Replace with your schema name\nAND TABLE_NAME = 'LEAD';   -- Replace with your table name\n```\n\n### Mapping Picklist Values\n\nIn the demo we demonstrate simple SQL to extract distinct values from our source data to so we can map to district picklist values into Salesforce. Here is source code that we use and paste into [DataTools Pro picklist mapping](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/mapping-and-migrating-salesforce-picklists/?utm_source=linkedin&utm_medium=linkedin&utm_content=erdstorytelling&utm_campaign=blogpost# \"Salesforce Picklist Mapping\").\n\n```sql\nSELECT COUNT(*),LEAD_STATUS FROM MIGRATION.STAGE.LEADS GROUP BY LEAD_STATUS\n```\n\n### Migration Mapping as Code\n\n[DataTools Pro will generate SQL code](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/migration-export-sql/ \"DataTools Pro SQL generation\") that you or your data team can run and modify to streamline the process. Data migrations are fluid by design so we typically employ common table expressions to help abstract mapping from the data preparation work needed.\n\n```sql\nWITH DataProcessingCTE AS (\n    -- Perform the complex data transformations here.\n    -- This can include joins, aggregations, case statements, etc.\n    -- This example is simplified and should be expanded based on your actual data processing needs.\n\n    SELECT *\n    -- IF your data tools provided\n    FROM LEADS\n),\nLEADS AS (\n    -- Optional: Any additional transformations that build on the previous CTE. Possibly fine tuning, renaming or calculated logic.\n    SELECT *\n        -- Further processing based on the previous CTE\n\n    FROM DataProcessingCTE\n)\n\n    -- Data Tools Generated SQL code intended to only map values as defined by DataTools.\n```\n\n[![Salesforce data migration mapping](https://datatoolspro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-16-may-2022-576x1024.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWqjeSNcZJA&t)\n\n![](https://datatoolspro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Copy-of-Copy-of-16-may-2022-1-576x1024.png)\n\n## Step 3: Prepare and Migrate Data\n\nIn this step we demonstrate some of the additional data preparation steps to combine multiple data sets. From there we, import our data using data loader manually into our Sandbox.\n\nOur new Salesforce instance is simple enough where we don’t need to worry about common automation issues. However, when you plan your migration you will want to consider the following:\n\n- Field validation rules\n- Triggered APEX functions and flows\n- Automatic communications like Email and SMS\n\n## More Salesforce Data Migration Resources\n\nHere are resources to help you plan and support a successful data migration into Salesforce.com.\n\n![Salesforce Data Migration Infographic](https://datatoolspro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Salesforce_Migration_Infographic.png)\n\n## Migration Launch Infographic\n\n[**View Infographic**](https://datatoolspro.com/salesforce-data-migration-infographic/ \"Salesforce Data Migration Infographic\")\n\n![Salesforce Data Migration Plan to Success](https://datatoolspro.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Flow-1.png)\n\n## Salesforce Migration Guide\n\n[**View Guide**](https://datatoolspro.com/salesforce-migration-services/salesforce-data-migration/ \"Mastering Salesforce Data Migration in 2023: Tips and Tools for a Successful Launch\")\n\n![Salesforce data migration checklist](https://datatoolspro.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/image-25.png)\n\n## Notion Migration Checklist\n\n[**View Checklist on Notion**](https://www.notion.so/Salesforce-Data-Migration-Checklist-b5a57565a07d46f5b4a7261bc73a0377)\n\n![Salesforce data migration pitfalls](https://datatoolspro.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/pitfall2.png)\n\n## Avoid these 3 Data Migration Pitfalls\n\n[**Read Article**](https://datatoolspro.com/sfdc_migration_issues/ \"3 Common Salesforce.com Data Migration Issues to Avoid\")\n\n## **Get access to our Salesforce data migration tool**!\n\nWe would love to learn about your data migration, management and analytics challenges.\n\n[Get Started!](/beta)"
