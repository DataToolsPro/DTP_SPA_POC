  "content_markdown": "**Effective September 2025**\n\nSalesforce is rolling out new security requirements for Connected Apps starting September 2025. These changes are designed to strengthen data protection and prevent unauthorized apps from accessing your Salesforce environment. If your organization uses DataTools Pro, action may be required to avoid interruptions.\n\n## What’s Changing\n\nSalesforce is tightening enforcement around uninstalled connected apps:\n\nWhat is an “uninstalled connected app?” – The term itself is a little confusing. Still, it refers to an app that has never been explicitly installed or previously installed and then uninstalled.\n\n- If a Connected App is authorized by a user but not installed in your org, Salesforce may **block its access**.\n- Only apps that are **installed and trusted** in your org will continue to work without issues.\n\nUnderstanding DataTools Pro security:\n\n[Security FAQ](https://datatoolspro.com/datatoolspro-data-security-faq/)\n\n[DataTools Pro Security Policy](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/security-policy-salesforce-connected-app/)\n\n[Getting Started Guide](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/datatools-pro-getting-started-guide/)\n\n---\n\n- [What’s Changing](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/authorizing-an-salesforce-uninstalled-app/#0-what%E2%80%99s-changing)\n- [How This Impacts DataTools Pro](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/authorizing-an-salesforce-uninstalled-app/#1-how-this-impacts-datatools-pro)\n- [End User Sign Up Errors](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/authorizing-an-salesforce-uninstalled-app/#2-end-user-sign-up-errors)\n- [How to Keep DataTools Pro Working](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/authorizing-an-salesforce-uninstalled-app/#3-how-to-keep-datatools-pro-working)\n- [What Happens If You Don’t Install DataTools Pro](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/authorizing-an-salesforce-uninstalled-app/#4-what-happens-if-you-don%E2%80%99t-install-datatools-pro)\n- [Enhance Security With IP Allow-Listing (Optional but Recommended)](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/authorizing-an-salesforce-uninstalled-app/#5-enhance-security-with-ip-allow-listing-optional-but-recommended-)\n- [Do I Need to Do This for Sandboxes Too?](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/authorizing-an-salesforce-uninstalled-app/#6-do-i-need-to-do-this-for-sandboxes-too)\n- [Who Should Perform These Steps](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/authorizing-an-salesforce-uninstalled-app/#7-who-should-perform-these-steps)\n- [Learn More from Salesforce](https://datatoolspro.com/tutorials/authorizing-an-salesforce-uninstalled-app/#8-learn-more-from-salesforce)\n\n---\n\n## How This Impacts DataTools Pro\n\nDataTools Pro integrates with Salesforce using a Connected App. We have followed best practices and completed a standard Salesforce review and code scan to participate in our [DataTools Salesforce App Exchange listing](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=594fa83f-42c9-42f0-9e9d-6e4576c52307 \"DataTools App Exchange\").\n\n- It is highly likely DataTools Pro has no installation status, like many connected apps in your org.\n- If your org shows DataTools Pro as “Uninstalled” under Connected Apps OAuth Usage, Salesforce may block access.\n- This can lead to failed logins, OAuth errors, or synchronization issues.\n\nLearn about DataTools Pro Security:\n\n[DataTools Pro Security Policy](/tutorials/security-policy-salesforce-connected-app/)\n\n[Security FAQ](https://datatoolspro.com/datatoolspro-data-security-faq/)\n\n[DataTools Pro - Salesforce Admin Install Guide](/tutorials/salesforce-admin-install-guide/)\n\n## End User Sign Up Errors\n\nWhen a non-Salesforce admin attempts to connect any app to Salesforce via Oauth that has not been installed, they will see an error: `OAUTH_APPROVAL_ERROR_GENERIC`. We have documented this process and solution (see next section)\n\n![](https://datatoolspro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-19.webp)\n\n---\n\n## How to Keep DataTools Pro Working\n\nTo ensure uninterrupted access, Salesforce Admins should:\n\n[Step 1: Sign Up for DataTools Pro as a Salesforce Admin](https://datatoolspro.com/beta?source=article-admin-installguide)\n\nStep 2: Confirm email one-time email authorization (we validate the authenticity of email)\n\nStep 3: Log in with Salesforce to authorize access to DataTools Pro (link provided in email)\n\nStep 4. Open Salesforce as Salesforce Admin, and Open your Connected Oauth Apps\n\n![](https://datatoolspro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3.webp)\n\nStep 5. Find DataTools Pro\n\nStep 6. Click “Install” – This provides control to Salesforce admins with visibility and control over app Policies.\n\n![](https://datatoolspro.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-1024x99.webp)\n\n---\n\n## What Happens If You Don’t Install DataTools Pro\n\nIf the app remains uninstalled:\n\n- Users may see **OAuth login errors** (e.g., `error=invalid_client`).\n- Scheduled jobs and **real-time syncs** could fail.\n- DataTools Pro may be unable to connect to your Salesforce org.\n\n---\n\n## Enhance Security With IP Allow-Listing *(Optional but Recommended)*\n\nFor added security, we recommend **restricting DataTools Pro access** to our **trusted infrastructure**:\n\n1. In Salesforce, go to:\n   **Setup → Security → Network Access**.\n2. Add the following **static IPs** used by DataTools Pro:\n\n```\n13.52.124.40\n3.224.67.34\n13.52.124.40\n```\n\nThis ensures only secure traffic from DataTools Pro can access your org.\n\n---\n\n## Do I Need to Do This for Sandboxes Too?\n\n**Yes.** Each Salesforce org — **Production, Sandbox, or Scratch** — manages Connected Apps independently. Repeat the steps in every environment where you use DataTools Pro.\n\n---\n\n## Who Should Perform These Steps\n\nA **Salesforce Administrator** with Setup access should perform the installation and configuration.\nIf you’re not an admin, please forward this guide to your Salesforce admin team.\n\n---\n\n## Learn More from Salesforce\n\nFor Salesforce’s official announcement, visit:\nSalesforce Help: Preparing for Connected App Usage Restrictions"
