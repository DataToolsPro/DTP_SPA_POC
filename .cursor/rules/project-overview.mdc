# DTP_APP_V3 — Project Overview

## What This Project Is
DataTools Pro **3.0** — the third major release. A React SPA front-end backed by a Laravel API.
The repo is a **monorepo** with two primary surfaces:

1. **Laravel backend** at the repo root (`app/`, `routes/`, `database/`, etc.)
2. **React SPA** in the [`dtp/`](mdc:dtp) subdirectory

A third surface, **AI/Agentic workflows**, lives in [`ai/`](mdc:ai).
