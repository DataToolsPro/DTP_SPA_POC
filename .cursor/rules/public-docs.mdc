# Public-Facing Documentation Rule

## When This Applies

After **any user story is completed** (code done, PR ready), evaluate whether documentation is needed. There are two types of docs, and both must be considered.

---

## Two Doc Types

| Type | Location | Format | Audience |
|------|----------|--------|----------|
| **Internal feature doc** | `docs/features/<MBT-XX>-<slug>.md` | Markdown | Developers / team |
| **Public tutorial** | `docs/public/<folder>/<slug>.json` | JSON (per skill) | End users / customers |

---

## Decision Gate

After completing a user story, answer these questions:

### 1. Internal feature doc (`docs/features/`)

| Jira Type | Required? | Action |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **User Story** | ✅ Always | Create or update `docs/features/<MBT-XX>-<slug>.md` using `docs/features/_template.md` |
| **Task** | ❌ No | PR description is sufficient |
| **Bug** | ⚠️ Only if user-visible behavior changed | Update existing feature doc if applicable |

### 2. Public tutorial (`docs/public/`)

| Question | If yes |
|----------|--------|
| Does this feature introduce a **new capability** the customer would learn about? | Create a new `docs/public/<folder>/<slug>.json` using the datatools-pro-docs skill |
| Does this feature **change how an existing capability works**? | Update the existing JSON doc — change `content_markdown` and `modified` timestamp |
| Is this a **behind-the-scenes** change invisible to the customer? | No public doc needed |

**Use the `datatools-pro-docs` skill** (`.cursor/skills/datatools-pro-docs/SKILL.md`) when creating or updating public docs. It defines the JSON format, folder structure, voice, and quality checklist.

## Where Public Docs Live

| Folder | Content area |
|--------|-------------|
| `docs/public/_general/` | Getting started guides |
| `docs/public/administration/` | Account, users, security |
| `docs/public/api/` | REST API |
| `docs/public/data-migration/` | Scorecard, mapping, SQL |
| `docs/public/dictionary/` | Objects, fields, tracking |
| `docs/public/erd/` | Entity relationship diagrams |
| `docs/public/integrations/<partner>/` | Partner-specific |
| `docs/public/metrics/` | Glossary, alias, AI analyst |
| `docs/public/reports-and-dashboards-datatools/` | Reports, dashboards |
