## What Is DataTools Pro?

DataTools Pro is a **Salesforce-connected platform that brings Salesforce and data cloud professionals together**. It manages an organization's metrics, data dictionary, entity relationships, migrations, and report governance — all within a single shared data model.

**Core value proposition:**
> DataTools Pro helps Salesforce administrators, data analysts, analytics professionals, and business teams collaborate more effectively by maintaining a living, connected documentation and governance layer on top of their Salesforce org.

## Who Uses It

| User Type | What They Do |
|---|---|
| Salesforce Administrator | Manages objects, fields, and org configuration; uses the Data Dictionary and ERD |
| Data Analyst | Tracks metrics, builds glossaries, documents field-level impact |
| Analytics Professional | Governs reports and dashboards, manages the report lifecycle |
| Business Stakeholder | Consumes published metrics glossary and ERD visuals |
| Migration Engineer | Maps source-to-target fields, manages migration projects, generates SQL |

## The Five Tools (All Share One Data Model)

DataTools Pro is a suite of five interconnected tools. They operate on the **same underlying data graph**, stored as a relational database. Changes in one tool are reflected across others.

| Tool | What It Does |
|---|---|
| **Metrics Glossary** | Defines, documents, and distributes Salesforce business metrics. Features the patent-pending **Metrics Analyst** that auto-generates a metrics glossary by reverse-engineering existing dashboards. Solves the "multiple versions of truth" problem by detecting metric aliases and conflicts across teams. |
| **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)** | Generates a live, interactive, business-oriented ERD from your Salesforce org in one click. Color-coded by relationship type. Drill from objects into fields. Export to PNG/SVG. Designed for visual storytelling — accessible to both technical and business users. |
| **Data Dictionary** | Live connected documentation of Salesforce objects and fields aligned to business initiatives; tracks what changed and the reporting/analytics impact |
| **Data Migration Tools** | Object and field mapping process management; replaces spreadsheets; generates SQL for ETL during migrations |
| **Report Management & Repository** | Governs the lifecycle of Salesforce reports and dashboards; enables categorization, searching, and adoption tracking |

See deep-dive docs in `docs/product/tools/` for each tool.

## Shared Data Model Concepts

All five tools operate on the same underlying entities. Key shared concepts:

- **Salesforce Org** — the connected Salesforce instance (multi-org support may exist)
- **Salesforce Object** — standard or custom Salesforce object (e.g. `Account`, `Opportunity`)
- **Salesforce Field** — a field on an object
- **Business Topic** — a grouping/categorization concept used to organize objects, metrics, and ERDs
- **Metric** — a defined, documented business metric tied to Salesforce fields/reports
- **Migration Project** — a data migration initiative with source-to-target mappings
- **Report / Dashboard** — a Salesforce report or dashboard under governance

See `docs/architecture/data-model.md` and `.cursor/rules/data-model.mdc` for the full entity map.

---

## Key Business Rules

- All data is scoped to an **Organization** (multi-tenant, row-level isolation)
- A Salesforce Org is connected via OAuth as a **Salesforce Connected App**
- Objects and fields are sourced from the live Salesforce org (not manually entered)
- Business Topics are user-defined grouping labels applied across all tools
- The same Salesforce Object/Field can appear in the Dictionary, ERD, Metrics Glossary, AND Migration Tools simultaneously — they share the same record

---

## What This Is NOT

- Not a general-purpose BI tool (no drag-and-drop chart builder)
- Not a Salesforce admin panel (no object/field creation — reads from Salesforce, doesn't write schema)
- Not a standalone ETL tool (Migration Tools generates SQL mapping guidance, doesn't execute migrations)
- Not limited to one Salesforce org per account (multi-org is a consideration)
